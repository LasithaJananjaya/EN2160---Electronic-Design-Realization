 ===========================================

This freeware program generates the standard Morse caracters, Q codes,
abbreviations, random series of characters and text files. It controls 
your knowledge through a Quiz test and helps you to get a good keying 
by monitoring your CW signals. Keying off air and verifying your 
transmission on the screen will let you go on air with less stress and 
more confidence.
It generates Wave sound files (*.wav) of morse characters that can be 
played by any media software.

Local characters can be created by yourself.
20 lessons are proposed to learn the Morse code. You can modify their 
contents as you like.

CW_Player needs a sound card and Win95 or more.

Besides the Help files, a few  hints are displayed  when the mouse points
on controls or boxes.
If you can't open the HLP file under Vista please look at this link :
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=6EBCFAD9-D3F5-4365-8070-334CD175D4BB&displaylang=en  

Windows features such as Copy (Control-C) and Paste (Control-V) can be 
used to select part of a random serie and replay it by copying in the 
Text box or save it in a file by using the Paste with your favorite 
editor. (Note that the TEXT window accepts only ONE record so, only ONE
line of an ASCII file can be pasted in this window.)

This program is mainly intended to be downloaded by WEB surfers from 
radioamateur sites.
Its purpose is to initiate non-radioamateur people and no-code licensed 
hams with Morse code and help them to get on the HF bands.

So, don't hesitate to propose this software to your visitors if you 
manage a radioamateur WEB site.

However, this program may also be used for your own morse training, for 
CW instructors or for training on the air by connecting one of the output
of your sound card to the audio input of your SSB or FM transceiver.

VERY IMPORTANT : 
While running this program under VISTA, WIN7, 8, 10 from a sub-directory under the directory Program Files, 
you will have to start this program as administrator anyway for getting full access to all functions of it, especially the recording of text files, image files, sound files. 
If you don’t do that, the produced files won’t be accessible because of the UserAccountControl (UAC) of Windows.
If you don’t want to run the program as admin, you have to install it in a sub-directory which is NOT under C:\Program Files,
but anyw<here else, for example C:\MyPrograms\. There, the function of the UAC takes no effect.

Enjoy CW and make others enjoy CW

- Miscellanous improvements to discover by yourself.

 Though this new release should be compatible with your older
 CWPLAYER.DAT file, it is recommanded to delete or to replace the old

 the first time. You will have to redefine your local characters but
 the job is not too hard !  

Version 1.8.2

 difficult to copy may be tripled. Then they will be played three times
 more often than the others.

 configuration. The back-up file is CWPLAYER.DAT.

Then, the parameter must be typed AFTER the last double quote :
      "C:\CW_Player.EXE" /f
