There are different microcontrollers available. ATMEGA 328P seems to be enough. Has 32kB program memory and 2kB SRAM.
SMD version of 328p is costly.

"The ATMega. The real benefit of using this microcontroller is that it's only $4 US,
whereas many other micro-controllers are 10X that price. It can also be easily programmed in the universal programming language, C++.
The ATMega is also equipped with a decent amount of memory for any project."
